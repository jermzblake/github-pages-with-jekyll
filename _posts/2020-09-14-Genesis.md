# In the Begining.  
After doing some self learning with Javascript on Codecadmey and freecodecamp, I've started going through Github lab's. Trying to gain an understanding of how to best utilize this site/tool. So far everything is pretty straight forward. I'm one week away from my first Software Engineering Immersive class at General Assembly I completed the pre-work assessment last friday. I got a *good* score but not GREAT.
